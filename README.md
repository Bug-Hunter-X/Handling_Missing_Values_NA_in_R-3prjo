This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to handling missing values (NA). The `bug.R` file contains code that attempts to calculate the mean of a vector containing NA values, which results in an error. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.R`, shows how to correctly handle missing values using the `na.rm` argument in the `mean()` function or by removing them with `na.omit()`.  This is a crucial aspect of data cleaning and analysis in R.
